        <video width="100%" height="350px" controls>
        <source src="wither.mov" type="video/mp4" ></video> 
        ↑ This animation was one of my favourite personal entries to the 10x10x24 challenge, a challenge which involved having to create and submit one 
        finished animation project every single day for ten consecutive days in 2024. 
        <br>
        It features two bunny rabbits planting seeds and dancing for rain after a forest fire. The narrative is based on the following lyrics from the song
        'Wither' by Frank Ocean: "Over where the trees burned down / The place where the fields went down in flames / We could put a whole in the ground / 
        Throw seeds and dance for rain."
        <br>
        This was animated digitally using Procreate Dreams.
        <h3 class=orange>Traditional Animation</h3>
        The following two examples of my animation work were made by drawing each frame manually on paper with the help of a lightbox. 
        The images of each frame were then cut together, like stop-motion, using the program DragonFrame.

        ↑ The first real works of handdrawn animation I ever made. The ↑ video contains 3 animations: one of a bouncing ball, one of a diver
        diving into a pool and the final is a creative work of a girl opening an enchanted box. 
        <br>I created all of these works in 2021 at a Summer Animation short
        course for teenagers held at UAL Central Saint Martins.

        ↑ Animated traditionally as a group project, responding to the prompt 'Shiny, shiny' during induction week at Edinburgh College of Art (2023). My partner animated the first half (blue ink) and I animated the second half (black ink). 
        <h3 class=yellow>Parallaxes</h3>

        ↑ My first ever attempt at a parallax animation. It includes vector illustrations I drew in Adobe Illustrator, which were then animated using Adobe After Effects.
        <iframe width="100%" height="350" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Bu1qujRuWfI?si=pqwXF1F-YGOISREt" title="YouTube video player"

                referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>
        ↑ An improved parallax animation using the same method. <br>

        <video width="32.8%" height=auto controls>
        <source src="env1.MP4" type="video/mp4" ></video>
        <video width="32.8%" height=auto controls>
        <source src="env2.MP4" type="video/mp4" ></video>
        <br>↑ Zoom parallaxes I made this past year using paintings I made in Clip Studio Paint and Adobe After Effects.<br>
        These have a different visual effect than parallaxes which move from one side of the screen to another, but the method
        for making a zoom parallax is still quite similar.<br>
