        ↑ This little clip of a bunny jumping and spinning around was one of first attempts at using and particularly animating in Blender
        and it was created only a few weeks ago, during the summer of 2025. The bunny is not rigged, none of its limbs or body parts move in a natural
        way, the lighting is not properly established so the bunny does not have shadows casted upon it like it should and mostly the bunny is gliding
        across the screen using keyframe animation as I am still mostly unfamiliar with how to use all of the tools in Blender. I definitely am trying
        my best to learn, though and have made good progress in quite a short amount of time.
        <br>
I did not make the bunny model myself, I used a 3D model I found on Fab and you can click <a href="https://www.fab.com/listings/32b8cf6c-0a64-49c3-88b9-02e96fa7b1b9">here</a>
        to view and download it.
        <br>
        I used a reference image of one of my 2D analogue illustrations as the background for the clip as at the time, I did not know how to create
        an actual background in Blender. I do think I would be able to create one now though, as I have become more familiar with the tools in
        Blender over the past few weeks.
        <br>
        If I were to rework this animation, following some feedback from the University of Hertfordshire, I would build the background, create better /
        basic lighting and shading for the bunny and rig the bunny model so I can make the animation look more natural and fluid and incorporate the use
        of some of the 12 principles of animation to make the movement of the bunny more visually interesting, dynamic and feel more grounded in reality /
        a set of rules.
