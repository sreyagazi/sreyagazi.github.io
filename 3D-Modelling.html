        ↑ I started working on trying to create a 3D model to a high detail level and on improving my
        unwrapping and texturing skills on the 16th of September 2025, after receiving some portfolio feedback
        from the University of Hertfordshire. This is a model I made of one of my original character designs.
        <br>
        The model is made entirely of mesh cubes, loop cuts and modelling my character to fit the silhouette
        of her reference images. It was a really great learning experience and helped me to grow much more confident
        about modelling in Blender very quickly. If I were to do this differently, I would model in a more traditional
        way rather than using cubes and loopcuts because in the end, my models' face does not have enough vertices for 
        me to properly sculpt her facial features.
        <br>
        I have included a screenshot from Blender to demonstrate how I used my own original character turnaround illustrations
        as reference images to essentially trace as I sculpted my character.
        <br>
        Next, I intend on rigging my character and animating her.
    <h3 class=pink>Environment Modelling (Tinkercad)</h3>
        <a href=""><img width=auto height="400px" src="3DModel.png"></a><br>
        ↑ I created this diorama of a bedroom earlier during the summer of 2025 when Blender still felt daunting and intimidating to me.
        I used a program called Tinkercad, which was created by Autodesk, free to use and which is much simpler and more intuitive for learning 3D modelling than Blender or Maya.
        Tinkercad is often used as an educational tool for children or by people who only want to 3D model for the sake of 3D printing. It was useful for me to do 
        some tutorials and practice modelling in Tinkercad before I moved on to Blender. Creating this diorama and receiving feedback on it from the University of Hertfordshire
        was useful for me to get a better understanding of scale and other 3D design principles.
